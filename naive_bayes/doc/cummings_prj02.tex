First, Bays theorem states that

$$ P(v_j | a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = \frac{P(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n | v_j) P(v_j)}{P(a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n)},$$

where $a$ is the attribute, $v$ is a value, $j$ is the number of different values and $n$ is the number of attributes.  If we assume conditional independence of the attribute values given the target value, we can say that $P(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n | v_j) = \prod_i P(a_i | v_j)$, where $i = 1,\ldots,n$.  Using this assumption, we can more easily estimate the class for which element $v_j$ belongs via the Naive Bayes classifier:

\begin{align}
  v_{NB} = \argmax_{v_j \in V}\left\{ P(v_j) \prod_i P(a_i | v_j) \right\},
\end{align}

where $v_{NB}$ denotes the target value output by the naive Bayes classifier.  The probability of picking value $j$ from the total pool of $m$ observations is given by $P(v_j) = \frac{\#(v_j)}{m},$ where $\#(v_j)$ is the number of elements with value $v_j$.

If we have a set of $m$ observations for each of the attributes $a_i$, $i = 1,2,\ldots,n$, we might try to find an appropriate distribution and model the probabilities from this distribution.  In doing this, we could calculate the $P(a_i | v_j)$ values by simply calculating the specific value on the distribution curve where this value occurs.  For example, if the data are distributed normally, we would plug this value $v$ into the function

$$f(v,\mu, \sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left( -\frac{(v-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} \right),$$

where $\mu$ is the mean of the data and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.  However, if we simplify further and simply use the binned data, we can eliminate any distribution requirements and simply use the data itself to classify new values.  Using this method requires either the same number of observations for each value, or normalization of the bins such that the sum of all the areas of each bin's rectangle is equal to one, i.e., the data are represented by a probability mass function:

\begin{align*}
  \int_v f(v,\mu,\sigma) dv &= 1, && \text{continuous distribution} \\
  \sum_n a_n &= 1, && \text{discrete data values}.
\end{align*}

To better illustrate the problem, I have run Naive Bayes classification on the fruit data set provided for this project along with a newly created data set with an order of magnitude lower number of observations for one fruit.

An $m$-estimation scheme has also been utilized for the binned data probabilities.  This converts the probabilities into

$$P(a_i | v_j) = \frac{n_{v_i} + mp}{n + m},$$

where $n_{v_i}$ is the number values with attribute $a_i$, $n$ is the total number of values observed with attribute $a_i$, $m$ is the size of the training set, and $p=1/m$.  This scheme removes difficulties which arise when $n_c$ or $n$ is zero.  The results using non-normalized and normalized data, along with their parameteric counterparts are shown below.

These results show that even with the normalization, the accuracy is still less than the parameterized estimate.  This may be due to a bug in the code...
